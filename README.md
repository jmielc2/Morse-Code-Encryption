# Morse Code Encryptor
This was my first independent project. It is a program (from english to Morse Code and vice vera) and game designed to help teach the user Morse Code. It includes examples and use of Regular Expressions, Imported functions and assets from other files, Opening and Reading of Files, and more. The whole program in its entirety can be run using the 'MainProgram.py' file.
