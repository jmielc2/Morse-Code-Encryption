# Morse-Code-Program-Proj.

This is my first large scale project that I made over the course of approximately three to four weeks. It is a relatively simple Python Program that includes both a Translate 
Program (from english to Morse Code and vice vera) and a game designed to help teach the user Morse Code. It includes examples and use of Regular Expressions, Imported functions
and assets from other files, Opening and Reading of Files, and more. If you have any comments or suggestions. The whole program in its entirety can be run using the 
'MainProgram.py' file. I hope this is useful!
